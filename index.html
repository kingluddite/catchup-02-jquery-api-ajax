      "A page can't be manipulated safely until the document is "ready." jQuery
      detects this state of readiness for you. Code included inside $( document
      ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready
      for JavaScript code to execute."

    <h2>After adding this change</h2>
    <p>
      We could put our JavaScript code in the head of our HTML but it is common
      practice to place your JavaScript at the bottom of your HTML just before
      the closing body element
    </p>
    <h2>Next: Let's add bootstrap to make our page nicer</h2>
