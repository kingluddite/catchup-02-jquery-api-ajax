# Activity 4
* Time (10 minutes)
* This task won't be easy but it's an important activity. The hardest thing about using other people's APIs, is learning to read documentation. It's okay if you don't get this, but keep trying for the full time allotted.

## Instructions
* Check out this Star Wars API https://swapi.co/documentation. Using the documentation as a guide and trying different query URLs, find the number of planets in the database.
